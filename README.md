# Spike Pong

This is an implementation of Pong (with some additional features) that runs in a browser. It was the first real project I ever made, and I figured I'd post the code exactly as I originally wrote it (note that I didn't much believe in documentation at the time). This is because I think it can be valuable to look back on naive code and ponder all the different development decisions I would make if I were to write a similar project now (for one thing, it shouldn't all be in one giant HTML file :D)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open SpikePong.html
3. Follow gameplay instructions on landing screen

If you choose to play with gravity, you can also toggle gravity on and off whenever you want during the game

By pressing the arrow in the direction of the other player, a player can spike the ball, doubling its speed until next time it's hit. The ball also speeds up gradually as a rally progresses, so spikes become deadly in longer rallies.
